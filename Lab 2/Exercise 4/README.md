Exercise 4: Applied Combinational Design

Purpose/How to Use:

Have the enable binary switch swithced to a 1. Then enter a 4-bit hex value (0 to F) into the hex keyboard as an input.

The circuit takes in the input of four bits and outputs a 1 if that unsigned number is a palindrome (Output Bit: Pal), that unsigned number has an odd parity (Output Bit: Parity), and overflow occurred when adding the unsigned 4-bit input value to itself (Output Bit: Over). Otherwise, it will output a 0.
