# Combinational-Circuits

This is a lab I had for Computer Architecture on combinational-circuits.
Within this lab, I:
-Learned how to use LogicWorks efficiently
-Practiced boolean algebra
-Converted numbers in binary, hexadecimal, and decimal form
-Utilized Karnaugh maps
-Found minimal Sum of Products (sum of minterms)
-Created circuits based on functions F
-Worked with logic gates and binary and hex input-output
-Created a custom device made for one of the circuits.

Each .cct file contains the LogicWorks file for each exercise. The screenshots are additionally in the repository to demonstrate what is in the .cct files in case you do not have LogicWorks.

The .pdf file contains what function F is demonstrated in each of the .cct files, as well as the truth tables associated, too.
