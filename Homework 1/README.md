Homework 1: Two 4-Bit Adder and Subtractor

Purpose: This circuit can output the sum or difference of two 4-bit numbers, depending on the user input on the "Op" switch.

How To Use:

For the "Op" switch (meaning "Operation"): 0 means Addition (A3 A2 A1 A0) + (B3 B2 B1 B0) = (S3 S2 S1 S0); 1 means Subtraction (A3 A2 A1 A0) - (B3 B2 B1 B0) = (S3 S2 S1 S0)

For 2's Complement, ALWAYS ignore the carry out digit, and focus on the 4-bit binary 2's complement answer (S3 S2 S1 S0). For addition, make sure that (
